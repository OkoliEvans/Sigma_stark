      Certainly! Here are some additional examples of constants in various
      application domains: 1. **Mathematical Constants:** - Constants like pi
      (π) or the speed of light (c) are not only useful in physics but can also
      be relevant in scientific computing or any application requiring precise
      mathematical values. 2. **Configuration Settings:** - Constants can be
      used to store configuration settings, such as timeouts, default values, or
      API keys. 3. **Physical Constants:** - Constants representing physical
      properties like gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²), Planck's constant
      (h), or Avogadro's number can be used in scientific simulations or
      educational applications. 4. **Financial Constants:** - In finance,
      constants like interest rates, tax rates, or maximum loan amounts might be
      declared as constants. 5. **Geographical Constants:** - Constants for
      Earth's radius, gravitational constant, or average temperature can be
      useful in applications related to mapping, weather, or environmental
      sciences. 6. **Game Development:** - In addition to the mentioned example,
      constants can represent game-specific values like character movement
      speeds, default weapon damage, or the rate of resource generation. 7.
      **Security Constants:** - Constants for cryptographic algorithms, key
      lengths, or security protocol parameters can be crucial in cybersecurity
      applications. 8. **Medical Constants:** - Constants like body temperature
      (98.6°F or 37°C) or maximum safe dosage levels might be used in healthcare
      applications. 9. **Educational Constants:** - Constants representing
      grading scales, exam passing scores, or classroom capacities can be used
      in educational software. 10. **Time-related Constants:** - Constants for
      seconds in a minute, minutes in an hour, or days in a week are often used
      in applications dealing with time and scheduling. These examples
      illustrate the versatility of constants across different domains, where
      having unchanging values is essential for consistency and predictability
      in the behavior of a program or system.
